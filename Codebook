This codebook focuses on tidydata.txt (see: https://github.com/Tughib/Getting-and-Cleaning-data/blob/master/tidydata.txt). 
This tidydata  has been generated from the original data, of which details can be found in the Readme file (see: https://github.com/Tughib/Getting-and-Cleaning-data/blob/master/README.md).

The tidydata contains the average and standard deviation features for each activity and subject.

1) The activity labels refer to the type of activity performed by the participating subjects:
WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test;
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test;
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test;
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test;
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test;
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test;

2) the (participating) subjects:
These are the IDd of the participating subjects in the test. 
Values range from 1 to 30, for 30 total testers.

3) for the remaining information, we refer to the .zip file as provided in the Readme.md file (see above), for example:
On the features (e.g. see features_info.txt in the .zip file);
On the research setting;
On the original variables (incl. units), and;
On the choices made in creating that data, incl. the experimental study design used.
